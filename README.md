# SQL-Challenge
SQL Project


The SQL schema changes are in the folder EmployeeSQL aa the file schema.  Run this file on an empty DB to create the tables.  Import the csv files from the Resources folder.
The file names are the same as the tables.  Follow the order of table creation on the imports.  THe ERD picture and the text for the creation of the ERD is also located in the 
EmployeeSQL folder.

The SQL to query the database is called Data_analysis and is in the folder EmployeeSQL.

For the bonus, that work is in the Jupyter notebook called company in the main folder of the repository.  WWhen running the notebook, you will need a file called .env.  This file
should contain the 2 lines below.

USER_NAME = Userid
PASSWORD = database_password

I did a few graphs to look at the data differently.
